# Okay Skill

End a reading session started with `/talk-shit`.

## Usage

```
/okay
```

## What It Does

1. **Summarizes** the conversation
2. **Logs** to daily session file (`sessions/YYYY-MM-DD.md`)
3. **Records** weekly insights:
   - Gaps: concepts you struggled with (`notes/YYYY-Www-gaps.md`)
   - Mastered: new understandings gained (`notes/YYYY-Www-mastered.md`)
4. **Encourages** you and suggests focus for tomorrow

## Output

You'll receive:
- Praise for what you accomplished
- A gentle nudge about what to revisit tomorrow

The assistant does NOT tell you what was logged — that's for your future self to discover.

## Weekly Growth Tracking

At the end of each week, you can review:
- `notes/YYYY-Www-gaps.md` — What challenged you
- `notes/YYYY-Www-mastered.md` — What clicked

This creates a growth journal over time.
